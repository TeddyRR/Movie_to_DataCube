details:
dC/dV amplitude images collected on two adjacent pnp transistors in SRAM memory while ramping the sample voltage from -2V to +2V. 
The voltage-dependent pn junction positions corresponds to the expected behavior. 
Some dopant defects are only visible at specific voltages. Scan size 3x3 um. Data courtesy of N.
